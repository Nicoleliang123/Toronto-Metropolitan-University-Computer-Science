     * Fill in the method below according to the description given
     * in the lab document. See the PDF in this archive.
     * 
     * You should test your code by calling your method in the main
     * method provided. One sample call is given, but you should write
     * your own test cases in main() and try them out as you go.
     * 
     * Once you're satisfied that your methods are producing the correct
     * results, you can scroll down to the very bottom of this file
     * for instructions on how to run the unit tests.
     * 
     * Note that your official lab grade will be based on the unit tests
     * and not what you wrote in main(), but it's still a good idea
     * to practice writing your own main() method. You won't always be
     * given unit tests.
